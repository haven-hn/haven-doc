## The Path to Privacy (Our Roadmap)
We are evolving through three distinct phases to ensure a balance between immediate utility, compliance, and long-term anonymity:

* **Phase 1 (Currently Live):** Prepaid virtual Mastercards for instant use.
* **Phase 2 (Under Development):** Direct spending from self-custodial wallets.
* **Phase 3 (Est. ~Q4 2026):** Full-stack private financial management.

## The Haven Card

### Overview
The Haven Card is a virtual Mastercard designed for instant issuance and global spending. It allows you to convert your on-chain assets into a spendable balance.

### Key Features
* **Format:** Virtual Credit Card only (for instant deployment to digital wallets). Other options are under development.
* **No KYC:** We do not require IDs, Proof of Address (KYC), or verify user data. Users simply provide basic self-declared information required to activate Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Samsung Pay. This data is strictly used for wallet provisioning and remains completely decoupled from your transaction history and account profile.
* **Seamless Onboarding:** Your card becomes available shortly after your funds are successfully loaded.
* **Network:** Mastercard.

### Supported Networks
You can fund your Haven card with stablecoins from the following networks:
* **Fuel** (Optimized for zero-fee issuance)
* **Ethereum Mainnet**
* **Arbitrum**
* **Base**
